# twirp-openapi-gen

This was imported from [github.com/blockthrough/twirp-openapi-gen](https://github.com/blockthrough/twirp-openapi-gen) and a few non-upstreamable changes were made. These changes are made in order to meet my needs in particular. If you want to use this tool, I recommend you to use the original repository.
